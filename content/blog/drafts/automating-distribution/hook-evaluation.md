- **Tone Alignment:** 5/5 - Perfect balance of educational and expert voice
- **Total Score:** 28/30

### Option B: Intriguing Question

## Selected Hook

Based on the evaluation, **Option E (Contrarian View)** is the most effective hook with a score of 29/30.

This hook excels because:
1. It immediately grabs attention with a familiar but challenged cultural reference
2. It establishes authority by presenting a contrarian perspective in a confident manner
3. It creates tension that draws the reader in (uncomfortable truth)
4. It's concise and punchy while still delivering a complete message
5. It perfectly matches our target tone that balances education with expertise

The "If you build it, they will come" reference also sets up an analogy that can be revisited throughout the article, creating cohesion. The strong language ("worthless without") creates urgency and emphasizes the critical importance of the topic.
