# Final Quality Check for "Your Bath Uses More Energy Than AI"

## Minor Corrections Needed

1. Replace placeholder "[insert alarming comparison]" in the AI headlines section with an actual example
2. Add brief sources/citations for key statistics:
   - UMass Amherst research (626,000 pounds of CO2)
   - Hugging Face calculations for inference energy
   - Household activity estimates in the comparison table
3. Add a brief explanation for "inference" similar to how "carbon negative" is explained
4. Consider adding 1-2 more subheadings in longer sections for improved scannability

## Suggested Enhancements

1. **Visual Elements**: Add specific descriptions for what the infographic should show
2. **Call to Action**: Strengthen the ending by encouraging shares in addition to comments
3. **Headline Testing**: Consider testing alternative headlines:
   - "Why Your Refrigerator Should Feel Guilty (Not Your AI Assistant)"
   - "The Surprising Truth: Common Activities That Use More Energy Than AI"
   - "Your Daily Bath vs. AI: The Environmental Impact Showdown"
4. **Credibility Note**: Add a brief methodology note explaining how the comparisons were calculated

## Final Polish

1. The conversational tone and humor work excellently - maintain this in any edits
2. The table format is effective - no changes needed
3. The opening scenario with the bath is particularly strong - keep as is
4. Consider adding one more compelling analogy in the conclusion section

This draft is very close to publication-ready with just these minor adjustments.
