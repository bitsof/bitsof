# Draft v1: Plan for "The Environmental Impact of LLMs: A Household Comparison"

## Scope
This article will examine the environmental impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) compared to common household activities, demonstrating that concerns about LLMs' energy usage have been largely overstated in public discourse.

## Audience
- Tech-savvy individuals concerned about AI's environmental impact
- Environmentally conscious readers seeking perspective on technology usage
- General public exposed to headlines about AI's carbon footprint

## Target Tone
Informed but conversational, slightly humorous while remaining factually grounded. The article should feel accessible to non-technical readers while providing sufficient technical depth to satisfy the tech-savvy audience.

## Key Takeaways
1. LLM energy usage occurs primarily during three phases: training, inference, and infrastructure maintenance
2. While training is energy-intensive, it's a one-time cost spread across millions of users
3. Everyday inference (usage) has minimal environmental impact compared to common activities
4. Technological improvements continue to reduce energy requirements
5. Smaller, specialized models offer dramatic efficiency improvements

## Structure Outline
1. Introduction: Framing the concern and promising perspective
2. Breaking down LLM energy consumption (training vs. inference)
3. Household comparisons: Direct energy usage comparisons
4. Contextual factors: Technology improvements, renewable energy
5. The case for smaller models
6. Conclusion: Maintaining perspective on environmental priorities

## Research Needs
- Energy consumption statistics for LLM training (cite research papers)
- Inference energy requirements for common models
- Carbon footprint of everyday activities for comparison
- Energy efficiency improvements in AI hardware/software
- Renewable energy adoption by major AI companies

## Key Representative Examples
- Comparison chart: LLM usage vs. household activities (bath, driving, etc.)
- Case study: Energy efficiency gains in smaller specialized models
- Visual representation of one-time vs. ongoing energy costs
