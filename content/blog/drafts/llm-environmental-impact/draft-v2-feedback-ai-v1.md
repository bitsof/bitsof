# Draft v2 Feedback for "Your Daily Bath Uses More Energy Than AI"

## Addressed Feedback Analysis
- Significantly improved conversational tone throughout
- Added more relatable analogies (bridge, private jet vs. scooter)
- Enhanced the comparison table with more everyday examples
- Created more attention-grabbing title that highlights the comparison angle
- Added placeholder for data visualization

## Remaining Clarity/Conciseness Issues
- Some technical terms still need brief explanations (e.g., "carbon negative")
- The visualization placeholder needs more specific description of what should be shown
- Consider breaking up some longer paragraphs for improved readability
- The "Green Computing Movement" section could be more directly tied to household comparisons

## Tone Improvements/Consistency
- Much better conversational tone with questions and direct address
- Good use of humor while maintaining credibility
- The "Let this sink in" section effectively emphasizes key points
- Opening could be even more attention-grabbing with a shocking comparison

## Polish/Fluency Suggestions
- Some sentences could be tightened further (e.g., "When headlines warn about AI's massive energy consumption, something important gets lost in the noise: perspective.")
- "You might be wondering" is used twice - vary transitional phrases
- Consider adding subheadings within longer sections to improve scannability
- The conclusion could be more impactful with a final memorable comparison

## Correctness Flags
- Still need verification for all numerical comparisons
- "Technology typically becomes more efficient faster than adoption grows" needs supporting evidence or qualification
- Carbon footprint breakdown percentages need citation
- "<0.1%" for AI usage needs verification or should be presented as an estimate

## Specific Enhancement Recommendations
1. Open with an even more surprising comparison to immediately grab attention
2. Add more humor throughout to maintain the conversational tone
3. Include specific actionable tips for readers concerned about environmental impact
4. Consider a "What about the future?" section that addresses potential scenarios
5. Add more concrete visuals or suggestions for infographics comparing household activities to AI usage
