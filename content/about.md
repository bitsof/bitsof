# About BitsOf

BitsOf was founded by a team of passionate developers with extensive experience crafting solutions across the spectrum of big data, enterprise software, and cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence.

We saw the transformative potential of AI early on and dedicated ourselves to understanding its intricacies â€“ not just the theory, but the practical application that drives real business value. We specialize in **Generative AI**, developing **agentic solutions with Large Language Models (LLMs)**, implementing **tool calling capabilities**, and integrating AI with automation platforms like **Zapier and N8N** to streamline business processes.

## Our Mission

Our goal is to bridge the gap between the potential of AI and its practical implementation. We help businesses navigate the complexities, identify opportunities, and build tailored AI capabilities that lead to tangible results, whether it's improving efficiency, unlocking new insights, or creating innovative products and services.

## The Team

We are problem-solvers at heart, combining technical depth with a focus on clear communication and achieving business objectives. Our hands-on experience includes building sophisticated AI agents, automating complex workflows, and fine-tuning models for specific industry needs.
