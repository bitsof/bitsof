# AI-Assisted Hook Generation & Selection Process

**Objective:** To generate multiple compelling hook options for an article and systematically select the most effective one using AI analysis.

**Core Principle:** A strong hook is crucial for grabbing reader attention and setting the stage. Generating variations and evaluating them increases the likelihood of finding the optimal opening.

## The Process

This process should ideally occur during **Phase 1 (Planning & Outline Review)** or as the very first step of **Phase 2 (Drafting)**.

1.  **Define Hook Criteria:** Before generation, establish what makes a good hook for *this specific article*. Common criteria include:
    *   **Engagement:** Does it grab attention? Is it interesting/intriguing?
    *   **Relevance:** Does it clearly relate to the article's main topic?
    *   **Clarity:** Is the hook easy to understand?
    *   **Promise:** Does it hint at the value or key takeaway for the reader?
    *   **Conciseness:** Is it brief and to the point?
    *   **Tone Alignment:** Does it match the intended overall tone of the article?

2.  **Generate Hook Variations (The Competition):**
    *   Instruct the AI to generate multiple (e.g., 3-5) distinct hook options for the planned article.
    *   Encourage variety by suggesting different angles:
        *   Problem/Solution (Address a reader pain point)
        *   Intriguing Question
        *   Direct Benefit/Promise
        *   Surprising Fact/Statistic
        *   Metaphor/Analogy
        *   Myth-Busting/Contrarian View

3.  **AI-Powered Evaluation & Automated Selection:**
    *   Instruct the AI to act as an impartial judge.
    *   Provide the generated hook options and the defined **Hook Criteria** (from Step 1).
    *   Task the AI to:
        *   Rate each hook option against each criterion (e.g., on a scale of 1-5).
        *   Provide a brief justification for each rating.
        *   **Select and output the strongest overall hook** based on the evaluation, explaining its reasoning. This recommendation is automatically used as the chosen hook for the draft.

## Example Prompt Structure for Evaluation (Step 3)

```
Act as an expert writing editor evaluating potential hooks for an article titled "[Article Title]" about [Brief Article Summary].

The key criteria for a strong hook are: [List Criteria from Step 1, e.g., Engagement, Relevance, Clarity, Promise, Conciseness, Tone Alignment].

Here are the hook options generated:

Option A: "[Hook Text A]"
Option B: "[Hook Text B]"
Option C: "[Hook Text C]"
...

Please evaluate each hook option against the criteria. For each hook:
1. Rate it on each criterion (scale 1-5, 5 being best).
2. Provide a brief rationale for your ratings.

Finally, recommend the hook you believe is the most effective overall and explain why it stands out based on the criteria.
```

**Integration:** The hook **selected by the AI evaluation** should then be used to start the drafting process (Phase 2).
